# Naive_Bayes_Classifier

This is a Naïve Bayes Classifer I created using Standard ML. Naïve Bayes classification is a simple machine-learning algorithm; some popular applications are categorizing news articles and labeling emails as "spam" or "not spam". The first phase of naïve Bayes classification is training, which is when word frequency counts are taken from a collection of already-labeled documents. Then, in the second phase, these word frequency counts are used to predict the categories for unlabeled documents.
