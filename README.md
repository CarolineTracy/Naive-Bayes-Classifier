# Naive_Bayes_Classifier

This is a na誰ve Bayes classifer I created using Standard ML. Na誰ve Bayes classification is a simple machine-learning algorithm; some popular applications are categorizing news articles and labeling emails as "spam" or "not spam". The first phase of na誰ve Bayes classification is training, which is when word frequency counts are taken from a collection of already-labeled documents. Then, in the second phase, these word frequency counts are used to predict the categories for unlabeled documents.

All the code for the na誰ve Bayes classifer is in the file classify.sml, which is in the folder 'TicTacToe_Files'. The other files consist of helper functions that are used within classify.sml.
