# Naïve Bayes Classifier

This is a naïve Bayes classifer I created using Standard ML. Naïve Bayes classification is a simple machine-learning algorithm; some popular applications are categorizing news articles and labeling emails as "spam" or "not spam". The first phase of naïve Bayes classification is training, which is when word frequency counts are taken from a collection of already-labeled documents. Then, in the second phase, these word frequency counts are used to predict the categories for unlabeled documents. This naïve Bayes classifer was created as part of my Functional Programming class.

All the code for the naïve Bayes classifer is in the file classify.sml, which is in the folder 'Bayes_Files'. The other files mainly consist of helper functions that are used within classify.sml.
